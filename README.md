Go GeoHash Library

This is very much a "work in progress".  It was created as I was unable to (quickly) find a geohashing library for golang 
that cause produce/handle integers instead of string encoding.

The initial version was heavily inspired by: https://github.com/sunng87/node-geohash  Thanks!

Current plans:
-Use it and see how it needs to be evolved.  
-Add more tests
-Add more documentation
-Add Travis build
-If there happens to be a need, perhaps add the string encoding/decoding
